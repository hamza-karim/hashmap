# hashmapThe first three key-value pairs will be inserted into the map successfully, each with a unique key. The insertion order will be maintained since the map uses a linked list to store the entries.

When attempting to insert the fourth key-value pair, the Put method will first check if an entry with the same key already exists in the map. If it does, the value associated with that key will be updated, and the size of the map will remain unchanged.

However, if the fourth key is not found in the map, a new entry will be created. Since the table size is set to 3, the oldest entry in the map will need to be removed to accommodate the new entry.

The LinkedHashMap uses a doubly linked list to keep track of the insertion order. Therefore, the oldest entry is located at the head of the linked list. To remove the oldest entry, its references (prev and next) will be updated accordingly. The new entry will then be appended to the tail of the linked list, representing the most recent entry.

The entryMap field, which is a map of keys to their corresponding nodes, will also be updated to include the new entry.

As a result, the total number of entries in the map will remain equal to the table size you specified (3), and the oldest entry will be evicted to make room for the new entry.

If you attempt to retrieve a value using a key that has been evicted, the Get method will return nil since the entry associated with that key is no longer present in the map.

It's important to note that the table size determines the maximum number of entries the map can hold at any given time. If you try to put more than the table size number of entries, the oldest entries will be automatically evicted to make space for the new ones.
